# ![Onyx Logo](logo.png)
Onyx is a high-level C++ library for rendering graphics to the screen using OpenGL 4.1 and GLFW 3.4.  

The intuitive and well-structured codebase makes it simpler than ever to code games, apps, or any graphical interface using a language as complex as C++.  

## Download
Onyx can be downloaded as pre-compiled binaries for Windows Visual Studio x64, or the source files themselves.  
Everything needed is included in the following links (from a release page, download the onyx-x.x.x.zip file under assets).

## Get Started
I'm always lost when trying to learn a library by reading it's massive documentation. So, I've created two tutorials: the [Basic Tutorial](https://github.com/jopo86/onyx/wiki/Basic-Tutorial) and the [Advanced Tutorial](https://github.com/jopo86/onyx/wiki/Advanced-Tutorial). I recommend you go through at least the basic tutorial before using the documentation.  
Full documentation will come with the full release (1.0.0).
